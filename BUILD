Pivot requires Java 5 or greater.

Ensure that all required libraries are on the Java classpath:  
- jcommon-1.0.12.jar and jfreechart-1.0.9.jar, available from http://www.jfree.org
- plugin.jar, availble from installed JDK
- servlet-api.jar (version 2.4), availble from http://java.sun.com/javaee
- stax-1.2.0.jar, available from http://stax.codehaus.org
  (this is only needed if compiling with a JDK 1.5 compiler)

Execute the following command from the current directory:

find . -name "*.java" | xargs javac
