Welcome to Pivot
================

Apache Pivot is a platform for building rich internet applications in Java.
It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features of a modern RIA
toolkit with the robustness of the industry-standard Java platform.

Like most modern development platforms, Pivot provides a comprehensive set of
foundation classes that together comprise a "framework". These classes form the
building blocks upon which more complex and sophisticated applications can be
built. Pivot classes are grouped into the following categories and distributed
in their associated libraries:


Distribution JARs
=================

* Core (pivot-core-incubating.jar):
  A set of common, non-UI-specific classes.

* WTK (pivot-wtk-incubating.jar, pivot-wtk-incubating.terra.jar):
  Classes for user interface development, including windows, dialogs, buttons,
  lists, text input, layout, drag and drop, XML markup, etc.

* Web (pivot-web-incubating.jar, pivot-web-incubating.server.jar):
  Classes to facilitate communication with and implementation of remote data
  services.

* Charting (pivot-charts-incubating.jar):
  Classes for adding interactive charting capabilities to Pivot applications.

* Tools (pivot-tools-incubating.jar):
  Development tools and utility applications.

To begin developing with Pivot, simply include the necessary libraries on your
project classpath.


Dependencies
============

Pivot requires Java 5 or greater.

* WTKX support in Java 5 requires StAX 1.2, available from
  http://stax.codehaus.org.

* Pivot's charting components require a compatible chart provider. No such
  provider is included in this release, but one is available here:

  http://code.google.com/p/pivot-jfree/  

  Version 1.1 of this provider is compatible with Pivot 1.2. Please note that 
  this provider has a dependency on JFreeChart, which is licensed under LGPL.

* Scripting support requires a compatible script engine. See
  http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223 or
  http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/index.html
  for more information.
