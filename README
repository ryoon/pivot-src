Welcome to Pivot
================

Apache Pivot is a platform for building rich internet applications in Java.
It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features of a modern RIA
toolkit with the robustness of the industry-standard Java platform.

Like most modern development platforms, Pivot provides a comprehensive set of
foundation classes that together comprise a "framework". These classes form the
building blocks upon which more complex and sophisticated applications can be
built. Pivot classes are grouped into the following categories and distributed
in their associated libraries:


Distribution JARs
=================

* Core (pivot-core.jar):
  A set of common, non-UI-specific classes.

* WTK (pivot-wtk.jar, pivot-wtk.terra.jar):
  Classes for user interface development, including windows, dialogs, buttons,
  lists, text input, layout, drag and drop, XML markup, etc. 

* Web (pivot-web.jar, pivot-web.server.jar):
  Classes to facilitate communication with and implementation of remote data
  services.

* Charting (pivot-charts.jar):
  Classes for adding interactive charting capabilities to Pivot applications.

* Tools (pivot-tools.jar):
  Development tools and utility applications.

To begin developing with Pivot, simply include the necessary libraries on your
project classpath.


Dependencies
============

Pivot requires Java 5 or greater.

WTKX support in Java 5 requires StAX 1.2, available from
http://stax.codehaus.org.

Charting requires JFreeChart 1.0.9 and JCommon 1.0.12, available from
http://www.jfree.org. Later releases may also work, but have not been tested.
