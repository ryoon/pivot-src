
Jenkins

This folder contains all the (additional) stuff required by Jenkins (CI Build Services at Apache) to build Pivot (from its maintenance branch).
This folder must be added to Jenkins as Source checkout, like what is done for Pivot maintenance branch.

To avoid multiple folder checkout from SVN, note that the jenkins folder will be checked out as root folder (.), 
while the Pivot maintenance branch will be checked out in a (sub)folder called pivot_maintenance (its value will be assigned to the build variable pivot.trunk).

In this way, the (main) build file will be that inside the Jenkins folder, and the (usual) Pivot build file will be included inside it,
and redefined/extended.

Note that during a Jenkins build, the environment variable jenkins.job is defined, 
so for example inside the same build files it's possible to have a different flow between standard (manual) builds, 
and automated builds by Jenkins.
