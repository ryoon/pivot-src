Release notes for Apache Pivot 1.1:

- Though the TextArea component is included in this release, it is not completely functional. It works reliably in a read-only mode, but support for editing is incomplete.

- Stub APIs for vector drawing are also included and are non-functional. Full support for vector graphics will come in a later release.
