Major enhancements in Pivot 1.1 include:

- New/updated components: 
  - Accordion - provides navigation capabilities similar to a tab pane, but 
    arranged vertically
  - Calendar - basic date picker; both standalone and drop-down versions are 
    supported
  - Slider - allows a user to select one of a range of values by moving a 
    draggable "thumb"
  - Color Picker - presents a list of selectable color swatches to the user
  - Support for checkboxes in tree and list views, including mixed state 
    checkboxes in tree view
  - Framework support for list, table, and tree view editors

- Improved drag/drop and clipboard support. Pivot applications can now interact 
  with the desktop just like native apps, with full access to the system 
  clipboard and drag/drop facilities.

- File browser support. Pivot now provides out-of-the-box support for browsing 
  the local file system. Combined with the new drag/drop support, this makes 
  Pivot an ideal choice for web-based file management applications.

- Input validation framework. Pivot 1.1 includes an extensible framework for 
  validating user input, allowing applications to provide instant and obvious 
  feedback when invalid data has been entered.
  
- Support for scripting languages in WTKX. In addition to Java, the new 
  <wtkx:script> tag allows developers to easily create Pivot applications using 
  a variety of JVM languages including JavaScript, Groovy, and others.

- Enhanced support for DOM interaction. Pivot now supports bi-directional 
  communication between an application and the web page that contains it. 
  Multiple applications on the same page can also communicate with each other.

- Additional effects and more pervasive animations. All of Pivot's navigation 
  components now use animated transitions; menus, list button popups, and sheets 
  use a translucent background; and menus and list buttons fade when closed, 
  providing a more enriching user experience.

- Improved font rendering. Pivot now uses the default system setting for font 
  smoothing, producing more natural-looking user interfaces.

- Numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.

Additional notes:

- Although the TextArea component is included in this release, it is not 
  completely functional. It works reliably in read-only mode, but editing 
  support is incomplete.

- Stub APIs for vector drawing are included but are non-functional. Full 
  support for vector graphics will come in a later release.
