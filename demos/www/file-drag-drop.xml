        <p>
            This application demonstrates Pivot's support for drag and drop. Users can drag files
            from the desktop or local file system into the applet for upload to a web or other
            server.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the application doesn't actually perform the upload - it merely serves as a
            demonstration of Pivot's ability to interact with the native OS.
