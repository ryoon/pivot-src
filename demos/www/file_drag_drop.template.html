<body>
<p>This application demonstrates Pivot's support for drag and drop. Users can
drag files from the desktop or local file system into the applet for upload to
a web or other server.</p>

<script src="http://java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
<script>
var attributes = {code:"org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet",
    archive:"lib/@project_name@-core-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.terra.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-demos-@version@.signed.jar",
    width:380,
    height:260
};
var parameters = {application_class_name:"org.apache.pivot.demos.dnd.FileDropTargetDemo",
    codebase_lookup:false
};
var version = "1.6";
deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version);
</script>

<p>Note that the application doesn't actually perform the upload - it merely
serves as a demonstration of Pivot's ability to interact with the native OS.</p>
