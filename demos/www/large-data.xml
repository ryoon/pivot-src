        <title>Large Data Sets</title>

        <p>
            This application demonstrates Pivot's ability to handle large data sets. The
            application reads CSV files containing from 10 to 1,000,000 rows and reports the
            amount of time it takes to load each file. It loads the rows on a background thread
            using a streaming API such that rows can be presented to the user as they are read.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, the CSV files are static. However, they could be dynamically generated
            from a database query or other back-end data source.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the 10e3.csv, 10e4.csv, and 10e5.csv files are not included in this
            distribution due to their large size.
        </p>
