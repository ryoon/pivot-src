<title>Pivot Large Data Sets Demo</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="demo.css">
</head>
<body>
<p>This application demonstrates Pivot's ability to handle large data sets.
The application reads CSV files containing from 10 to 1,000,000 rows and
reports the amount of time it takes to load each file. It loads the rows on a
background thread using a streaming API such that rows can be presented to the
user as they are read.</p>

<p>In this example, the CSV files are static. However, they could be dynamically
generated from a database query or other back-end data source.</p>

<p>Note that the 10e3.csv, 10e4.csv, and 10e5.csv files are not included in
this distribution due to their large size.</p>
