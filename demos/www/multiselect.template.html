<title>Pivot Multiple Selection Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This application demonstrates Pivot's use of ranges to maintain selection state in a ListView component. This is more efficient than maintaining a list of individual selected indexes.</p>

<script src="http://java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
<script>
var attributes = {code:"org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet",
    archive:"lib/@project_name@-core-@version@.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.terra.jar,lib/@project_name@-demos-@version@.jar",
    width:480,
    height:360
};
var parameters = {application_class_name:"org.apache.pivot.demos.lists.MultiSelect",
    codebase_lookup:false
};
var version = "1.6";
deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version);
</script>

<p>TableView also maintains selection in this manner.</p>
