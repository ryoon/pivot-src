<p>This application is a simple receive-only IM client that serves as a demo of
how "push"-style applications can be built in Pivot.</p>

<p>To use the demo, log into the application using a valid Jabber account.
Then, from another account, send messages to the account used to log in to the
application. The demo will briefly display each message received and add it to
a log of messages in the space below the horizontal rule.</p>
