<p>This application demonstrates how to build a simple RSS client in Pivot. It
uses a custom list view item renderer to present the news data. Double-clicking
an item in the list will open the article in a new window.</p>

<p>Note that this applet requires Java 6 Update 10 or later, since it relies on
the existence of a crossdomain.xml file on the server in order for an unsigned
applet to request the news feed.</p>
