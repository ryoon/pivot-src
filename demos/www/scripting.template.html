<title>Pivot Scripting Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This application demonstrates Pivot's scripting capabilities. It uses
JavaScript and Groovy to implement event handlers and populate a list view
component with data. It also demonstrates data sharing between script and Java
code:</p>

<script src="http://java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
<script>
var attributes = {code:"org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet",
    archive:"lib/@project_name@-core-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.terra.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-demos-@version@.signed.jar,lib/groovy-engine.signed.jar,lib/groovy-all-1.6.3.signed.jar",
    width:640,
    height:480
};
var parameters = {application_class_name:"org.apache.pivot.demos.scripting.ScriptingDemo",
    codebase_lookup:false
};
var version = "1.6";
deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version);
</script>

<p>The applet is signed because the Groovy scripting engine relies on bytecode
generation, which is not allowed in untrusted applets.</p>
