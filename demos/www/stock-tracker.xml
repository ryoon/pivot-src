            This sample application retrieves live (delayed by 15 minutes) stock quote data from
            Yahoo! Finance as a CSV file and presents it in a table view component (the applet is
            signed to allow it to communicate with the Yahoo web service):

            Users can add or remove stock symbols using the text input and buttons at the bottom
            of the applet. Selecting a row in the table shows additional information about the
            stock in the form on the right. The data is automatically updated every 15 seconds.
