        <title>Stock Tracker</title>
        <description>
            An example of a simple but practical "real world" Pivot application. It monitors stock
            quotes provided by <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Finance</a>.

    <body>
        <p>
            This sample application retrieves live (delayed by 15 minutes) stock quote data from
            Yahoo! Finance as a CSV file and presents it in a table view component (the applet is
            signed to allow it to communicate with the Yahoo web service):
        </p>
        <application class="org.apache.pivot.tutorials.stocktracker.StockTracker"
            width="480" height="360">
            <libraries signed="true">
                <library>core</library>
                <library>wtk</library>
                <library>wtk-terra</library>
                <library>web</library>
                <library>tutorials</library>
            </libraries>
            <startup-properties>
                <language>en</language>
            </startup-properties>
        </application>
        <p>
            Users can add or remove stock symbols using the text input and buttons at the bottom
            of the applet. Selecting a row in the table shows additional information about the
            stock in the form on the right. The data is automatically updated every 15 seconds.
