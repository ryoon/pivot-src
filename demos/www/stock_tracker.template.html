<body>
<p>This sample application retrieves live (delayed by 15 minutes) stock quote
data from Yahoo! Finance as a CSV file and presents it in a table view component
(the applet is signed to allow it to communicate with the Yahoo web service):</p>

<script src="http://java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
<script>
var attributes = {code:"org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet",
    archive:"lib/@project_name@-core-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-web-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.terra.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-tutorials-@version@.signed.jar",
    width:480,
    height:360
};
var parameters = {application_class_name:"org.apache.pivot.tutorials.stocktracker.StockTracker",
    startup_properties:"language:en",
    codebase_lookup:false
};
var version = "1.6";
deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version);
</script>

<p>Users can add or remove stock symbols using the text input and buttons at
the bottom of the applet. Selecting a row in the table shows additional
information about the stock in the form on the right. The data is automatically
updated every 15 seconds.</p>
