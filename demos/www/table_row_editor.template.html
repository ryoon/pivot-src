<title>Pivot Table Row Editor Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This sample application demonstrates the use of a flip transition to bring
up a table view row editor.</p>

<script src="http://java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
<script>
var attributes = {code:"org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet",
    archive:"lib/@project_name@-core-@version@.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.terra.jar,lib/@project_name@-demos-@version@.jar",
    width:480,
    height:360
};
var parameters = {application_class_name:"org.apache.pivot.demos.roweditor.RowEditorDemo",
    codebase_lookup:false
};
var version = "1.6";
deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version);
</script>

<p>Users can double click on any row to bring up the editor. Pressing the Enter
key or clicking outside the bounds of the editor will save the edits, and
pressing the Escape key will cancel the edits.</p>
