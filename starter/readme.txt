Requires Ant 1.7 or greater to build, available from http://ant.apache.org/. Requires Java 5 or greater to run, available from http://java.com/getjava/.

To build, run ant from this directory. To run as an applet, load index.html in a web browser. To run as a desktop application, run starter.sh (UNIX) or starter.bat (Windows) from a command prompt (UNIX users may need to assign execute permissions to the launch script).
