<h1>Bounded Range Components</h1>

<p>"Bounded range" components allow a user to interactively select one of a bounded range of values. Bounded range components in Pivot include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="scroll_bars.html"><b>ScrollBar</b></a> - Allows a user to select one of a range of values using up/down buttons or a draggable "thumb" that also represents an extent value. Most often used to facilitate scrolling in a scroll pane but can be used in other contexts.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="sliders.html"><b>Slider</b></a> - Allows a user to select one of a range of values by dragging the mouse.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="spinners.html"><b>Spinner</b></a> - An "up/down" control allowing a user to cycle through a range of pre-defined values.</p></li>
</ul>
