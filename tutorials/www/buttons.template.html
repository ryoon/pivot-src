<h1>Buttons</h1>
<p>Pivot supports the standard set of common button types including push buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes. A button resembling an HTML hyperlink is also supported.</p>

<p class="caption">Some Pivot buttons.</p>

<p>Pivot also provides two additional button classes that expand on the functionality offered by the basic button types: <tt>ListButton</tt> and <tt>MenuButton</tt>. List buttons are similar to an HTML <tt>&lt;select&gt;</tt> and are discussed in the <a href="lists.html">Lists</a> tutorial. Menu buttons are similar to list buttons but provide drop-down access to a popup menu rather than a list; they are discussed in the the <a href="menus.html">Menus</a> section.</p>

<p><tt>Menu.Item</tt> and <tt>MenuBar.Item</tt> are two additional Button subclasses. They are also discussed in the Menus section.</p>
