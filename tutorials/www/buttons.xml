            Pivot also provides a number of additional button classes that expand on the
            functionality offered by the basic button types:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <tt>ListButton</tt> - Also known as "drop-downs", list buttons are similar to
                    an HTML <tt>&lt;select&gt;</tt> element. They are discussed in the
                    <a href="lists.html">Lists</a> section of the tutorial.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <tt>MenuButton</tt> - Menu buttons are similar to list buttons but provide
                    drop-down access to a popup menu rather than a list; they are discussed in the
                    <a href="menus.html">Menus</a> section.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <tt>CalendarButton</tt> - Provide drop-down access to a calendar component;
                    discussed in the <a href="calendars.html">Calendars</a> section.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <tt>ColorChooserButton</tt> - Provide drop-down access to a color chooser
                    component; discussed in the <a href="color-choosers.html">Color Choosers</a>
                    section.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <tt>Menu.Item</tt> and <tt>MenuBar.Item</tt> are two additional Button subclasses. They
            are used primarily by the menu components and are discussed in the
            <a href="menus.html">Menus</a> section.
