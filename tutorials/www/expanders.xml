        <p>
            Expanders are often used to present small amounts of information to the user. Since the
            information may not be relevant to the user all the time, expanders allow the user to
            "collapse" the panel to make more room for other content, similar to rolling up a
            window shade. The following example demonstrates the use of the <tt>Expander</tt>
            component:
        </p>

        <p>
            The BXML source for this example is as follows. It declares three expanders contained
            in a vertical flow pane, which itself is contained in a scroll pane. The contents of
            the expanders are defined in several external BXML files that are included by the main
            file:
        </p>

        <p>
            Since this example does not require any logic, there is no associated Java or script
            code.
