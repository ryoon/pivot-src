<h1>Layout Containers</h1>

<p>Layout containers are used primarily to arrange other components on the screen. Layout containers include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="flow_panes.html"><b>FlowPane</b></a> - Container that arranges components in a horizontal line, wrapping when contents don't fit on a single line.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="box_panes.html"><b>BoxPane</b></a> - Container that arranges components in a line, either vertically or horizontally.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="table_panes.html"><b>TablePane</b></a> - A container that lays out its children in a two-dimensional table structure, optionally spanning table cells.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="grid_panes.html"><b>GridPane</b></a> - Similar to TablePane, but without spanning cells and where each cell is the same size.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="borders.html"><b>Border</b></a> - A container with an optional title that draws a border around a single content component.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="stack_panes.html"><b>StackPane</b></a> - Arranges components in layers, like a stack of transparencies.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="split_panes.html"><b>SplitPane</b></a> - Provides a draggable divider between two components allowing a user to dynamically change the size of each; may be horizontal or vertical.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="forms.html"><b>Form</b></a> - Arranges components in a "form" layout with labels to the left and optional flag messages (e.g. to alert a user to input errors) to the right.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="panels.html"><b>Panel</b></a> - Performs no layout, allowing the application to specify absolute component positions and sizes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these are discussed in detail in the following sections.</p>
