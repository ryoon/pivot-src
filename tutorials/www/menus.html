<h1>Menus</h1>
Menus are used to present a user with a hierarchical selection of options. Pivot supports three primary means of incorporating menus into an application:

<ul>
<li><a href="context_menus.html"><b>Context Menus</b></a> - generally provide convenient "right-click" access to context-sensitive functionality.</li>
<li><a href="menu_bars.html"><b>Menu Bars</b></a> - collection of menus generally located at the top of an application window that provide access to major application features.</li>
<li><a href="menu_buttons.html"><b>Menu Buttons</b></a> - provide access to "drop-down" menus, similar to <a href="list_buttons.html">list buttons</a>; often used in toolbars.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Context menus are discussed first.</p>
