    <body>
        <p>
            Menus are used to present a user with a hierarchical selection of options. Pivot
            supports three primary means of incorporating menus into an application:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="context-menus.html"><b>Context Menus</b></a> - generally provide
                convenient "right-click" access to context-sensitive functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="menu-bars.html"><b>Menu Bars</b></a> - collection of menus generally
                located at the top of an application window that provide access to major
                application features.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="menu-buttons.html"><b>Menu Buttons</b></a> - provide access to "drop-down"
                menus, similar to <a href="list-buttons.html">list buttons</a>; often used in
                toolbars.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Context menus are discussed first.
