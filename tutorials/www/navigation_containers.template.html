<h1>Navigation Containers</h1>

<p>Navigation containers are used to maximize screen real estate, showing or hiding their children as needed. Navigation containers include:</p>

<li><p><a href="card_panes.html"><b>CardPane</b></a> - A simple "card stack" of components, only one of which is visible at a time.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="tab_panes.html"><b>TabPane</b></a> - Similar to <tt>CardPane</tt> but with built-in "tabs" for navigation; may optionally be "collapsed" such that only the tab buttons show.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="accordions.html"><b>Accordion</b></a> - Similar to <tt>TabPane</tt>, but subcomponents are presented like the folds of an accordion, with headers for navigating between panels.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="expanders.html"><b>Expander</b></a> - Similar to a border but collapsible such that only the title shows.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="rollups.html"><b>Rollup</b></a> - Similar to <tt>Expander</tt> but can contain an aribitrary number of child components; when collapsed, only the first component is visible. Can be nested to create the appearance of a "tree" structure.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="viewport.html"><b><i>Viewport</i></b></a> - Abstract base class for a scrollable region. Sublcasses of <tt>Viewport</tt> include:
<ul>
<li><a href="scroll_panes.html"><b>ScrollPane</b></a> - A scrollable area with optional vertical and horizontal scroll bars as well as row and column headers.</li>
<li><a href="panoramas.html"><b>Panorama</b></a> - A scrollable area with optional up/down/left/right arrows.</li>
</ul></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these are discussed in detail in the following sections.</p>
