        <p>
            Separators are simple components that are similar to a horizontal rule in HTML. They
            have an optional heading and are generally used to partition content, as shown in the
            sample application below:
        </p>

        <application class="org.apache.pivot.wtk.ScriptApplication"
            width="420" height="180">
            <libraries>
                <library>core</library>
                <library>wtk</library>
                <library>wtk-terra</library>
                <library>tutorials</library>
            </libraries>
            <startup-properties>
                <src>/org/apache/pivot/tutorials/separators/separators.bxml</src>
            </startup-properties>
        </application>

        <p>
            The BXML for this sample is as follows. Note that the box pane sets the "fill" style to
            true; otherwise, the separator would not grow to fill the horizontal space:
        </p>

        <source type="xml" location="org/apache/pivot/tutorials/separators/separators.bxml">
            <![CDATA[
            <Window title="Separators" maximized="true"
                xmlns:bxml="http://pivot.apache.org/bxml"
                xmlns="org.apache.pivot.wtk">
                <BoxPane orientation="vertical" styles="{padding:4, spacing:10, fill:true}">
                    <Separator heading="Section 1"/>
                    <Label text="This is the content of section 1."/>

                    <Separator heading="Section 2"/>
                    <Label text="This is the content of section 2."/>

                    <Separator heading="Section 3"/>
                    <Label text="This is the content of section 3."/>
                </BoxPane>
            </Window>
            ]]>
        </source>

        <p>
            Since this example contains no logic, there is no associated Java source.
