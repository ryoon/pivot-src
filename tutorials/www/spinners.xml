        <p>
            <tt>Spinner</tt> is a component that provides a means of cycling through a list of
            items. The items are defined by the spinner's model data, specified via the
            "spinnerData" property. Spinners behave similarly to a single-select
            <tt>ListView</tt> or a <tt>ListButton</tt>, allowing a user to select one of the items
            in the list. However, unlike list views and list buttons, spinners only present a
            single item at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that spinners may be "circular". When a spinner's "circular" property is set to
            <tt>true</tt>, the spinner's selection will wrap when it reaches the first or last
            item in the list. In the following example, the first spinner is circular, and the
            second is not:

                <library>core</library>
                <library>wtk</library>

        <p>
            Because spinner data is specified using an instance of the <tt>List</tt> interface,
            spinners are quite flexible. The second spinner in the above example uses an instance
            of <tt>NumericSpinnerData</tt> as its model. This class is a lightweight means of
            representing a list of numeric value options: it doesn't actually store the values as
            a list in memory - it simply calculates the appropriate value for a given index using
            its lower and upper bounds and increment value.
