        <p>
            Stack panes arrange their children in layers, like a stack of transparencies.
            Unlike <a href="card-panes.html">card panes</a>, which show only a single component at
            a time, stack panes always display all of their child components. Components with a
            higher z-index (position within the stack pane) are painted on top of components with
            a lower z-index.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following example shows a stack pane containing an image view and a label. The
            label is layered on top of the image:
        </p>

            The BXML source for the example is as follows:

            <![CDATA[

                        styles="{fill:true, preserveAspectRatio:false}"/>
                    <Label text="StackPane Demo"
                        styles="{font:'Helvetica bold 64', color:'#ffffff', wrapText:true,
                            horizontalAlignment:'center', verticalAlignment:'center'}"/>
                </StackPane>
            </Window>
            ]]>
        </source>

        <p>
            Since this example contains no logic, there is no associated Java source.
