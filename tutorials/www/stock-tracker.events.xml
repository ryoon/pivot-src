    <body>
        <p>
            While WTKX is often used to declare the <i>structure</i> of an application, the
            application's <i>behavior</i> is still defined in code (either Java or a JVM-compatible
            scripting language). Most application logic is executed in response to an "event"
            triggered by some external source, such as user input or the completion of an asynchronous
            operation running in a background thread.
        </p>

        <h2>Loading the UI</h2>

        <p>
            In general, a Pivot application will load its user interface in the <tt>startup()</tt>
            method of the main application class. This method, along with the <tt>shutdown()</tt>,
            <tt>suspend()</tt>, and <tt>resume()</tt> methods, is defined by the <tt>Application</tt>
            interface, which all Pivot applications must implement.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <tt>StockTracker</tt> class implements the <tt>Application</tt> interface for the
            Stock Tracker application. <tt>StockTracker</tt>'s <tt>startup()</tt> method is shown
            below:
        </p>

            // Set the locale
            String language = properties.get(LANGUAGE_PROPERTY_NAME);

                Locale.setDefault(new Locale(language));
            }

        <p>
            This code does the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Retrieves the "langauge" argument that was provided to the application context
                    when it was created - for desktop applications, this is a command-line
                    argument; in the browser, it is either passed via an applet parameter
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sets the default locale to an instance corresponding to the language
                    argument
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Loads the application resources
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Creates an instance of <tt>WTKXSerializer</tt> and loads the WTKX source
                </p>

        </ul>

        TODO

        <p>
            Note that the <tt>StockTrackerWindow</tt> implements the
            <tt>org.apache.pivot.wtkx.Bindable</tt> interface. This interface allows elements
            defined in a WTKX file to be automatically mapped to member variables in the root
            element class. Any member variable tagged with the <tt>@WTKX</tt> annotation will be
            automatically populated when the WTKX is loaded with the corresponding element
            declared in the WTKX file (WTKX elements are identified via the <tt>wtkx:id</tt>
            attribute, which behaves similar to a variable name in Java). The <tt>initialize()</tt>
            method is called to notify the class that the WTKX file has been completely processed
            and that the member variables are now available for event registration and other
            application setup tasks.
        </p>

            @WTKX private TableView stocksTableView;
            @WTKX private TextInput symbolTextInput;

            @WTKX private Button removeSymbolsButton;

        </source>

        <p>
            These annotations eliminate much of the boilerplate code required when loading WTKX
            contents manually via an instance of <tt>WTKXSerializer</tt>. However, since they rely
            on reflection code that may need to set private member variables, they can generally
            only be used by trusted code, such as a locally installed application or a signed
            applet or Web Start application.
        </p>

        <h2>Adding Event Listeners</h2>

        <p>
            TODO This is in initialize() now

            At this point, the entire UI has been created, but it is not yet visible. Even if it
            was, it wouldn't do much, since no event handlers have been added. The next thing
            <tt>startup()</tt> does is add a number of event handlers:
        </p>

        <source type="java">
            <![CDATA[
            stocksTableView.getTableViewSelectionListeners().add(new TableViewSelectionListener.Adapter() {
                public void selectedRangesChanged(TableView tableView, Sequence&lt;Span&gt; previousSelectedRanges) {
                    refreshDetail();
                }
            });
            ...

            addSymbolButton.getButtonPressListeners().add(new ButtonPressListener() {
                public void buttonPressed(Button button) {
                    addSymbol();
                }
            });
            ...
            ]]>
        </source>

        <p>
            A caller signals its interest in a particular event by implementing an interface that
            defines an event handler method and adding itself as an event lister on the event
            source. In the example above, two event handlers are created: a selection change
            listener on the stock quote table view and a button press listener on the "add symbol"
            button. Some listener interfaces, such as those shown here, define only a single event
            handler method, but others define more than one and serve as a grouping of related
            events. Interfaces with multiple handler methods generally define an inner Adapter
            class that can be used to simplify subclassing, as shown above.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that, though these handlers are implemented as anonymous inner classes, this is
            not required - any class that implements the appropriate listener interface can
            register as a listener. It is also possible to define listeners in script within the
            WTKX file itself; this is discussed in more detail in the
            <a href="scripting.html">Scripting</a> section.
        </p>

        <h2>Displaying the Content</h2>

        <p>
            TODO Move this up to the top

            Finally, the window loaded from the WTKX files is opened, making the application
            visible and allowing the user to begin interacting with it (note that the window's
            "maximized" property is set to "true" in the WTKX file so that, when opened, the
            window will be sized to fit the entire display area):
        </p>

TODO This was moved to open()

        <source type="java">
            <![CDATA[
            window.open();

            refreshTable();

            ApplicationContext.setInterval(new Runnable() {
                public void run() {
                    refreshTable();
                }
            }, REFRESH_INTERVAL);

            symbolTextInput.requestFocus();
            ]]>
        </source>

        <p>
            The code then calls <tt>refreshTable()</tt> to load the stock quote data and sets a
            timer interval to reload the data every 15 seconds. Finally, it sets the focus to the
            symbol text input, so a user can easily add a new stock to track.
