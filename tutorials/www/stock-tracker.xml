        <title>The "Stock Tracker" Application</title>
    </properties>

    <body>
        <p>
            This section walks through the implementation of a simple but practical "stock tracker"
            sample application. It demonstrates a number of key features used by many "real world"
            applications, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>UI markup using BXML</li>
            <li>Event handling</li>
            <li>Web queries</li>
            <li>Data binding</li>
            <li>Localization</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The sample application is shown below. The application retrieves live (delayed by 15
            minutes) stock quote data from <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Finance</a>
            as a CSV file and presents it in a table view component (the applet is signed to allow
            it to communicate with the Yahoo web service):
        </p>

        <application class="org.apache.pivot.tutorials.stocktracker.StockTracker"
            width="480" height="360">
            <libraries signed="true">
                <library>core</library>
                <library>web</library>
                <library>wtk</library>
                <library>wtk-terra</library>
                <library>tutorials</library>
            </libraries>
            <startup-properties>
                <language>en</language>
            </startup-properties>
        </application>

        <p>
            Users can add or remove stock symbols using the text input and buttons at the bottom
            of the applet. Selecting a row in the table shows additional information about the
            stock in the form on the right. The data is automatically updated every 15 seconds.
