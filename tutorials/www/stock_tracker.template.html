<h1>Stock Tracker</h1>

<p>This section walks through the implementation of a simple but practical "stock tracker" sample application. It demonstrates a number of key features used by many "real world" applications, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>UI markup using WTKX</li>
<li>Event handling</li>
<li>Web queries</li>
<li>Data binding</li>
<li>Localization</li>
</ul>

<p>The sample application is shown below. The application retrieves live (delayed by 15 minutes) stock quote data from <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Finance</a> as a CSV file and presents it in a table view component (the applet is signed to allow it to communicate with the Yahoo web service):</p>

<script>
var attributes = {code:"org.apache.pivot.wtk.BrowserApplicationContext$HostApplet",
    archive:"lib/@project_name@-core-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-web-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-wtk-@version@.terra.signed.jar,lib/@project_name@-tutorials-@version@.signed.jar",
    width:480,
    height:360
};
var parameters = {application_class_name:"org.apache.pivot.tutorials.stocktracker.StockTracker",
    startup_properties:"language:en",
    codebase_lookup:false
};
deployJava.writeAppletTag(attributes, parameters);
</script>

<p>Users can add or remove stock symbols using the text input and buttons at the bottom of the applet. Selecting a row in the table shows additional information about the stock in the form on the right. The data is automatically updated every 15 seconds.</p>
