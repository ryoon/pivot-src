            This tutorial provided an introduction to all of the major features provided by the
            Pivot platform. Though it did not delve into great detail on any particular feature,
            the examples should have established a strong foundation upon which further skills can
            be built.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next section contains a complete example that incorporates many of the features
            introduces in the previous sections. Though it does not introduce any new material,
            readers may find it valuable to see these features in action in a practical,
            "real-world" example.
