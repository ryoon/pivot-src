            While some button types, such as radio buttons and checkboxes, are always toggle
            buttons, other types, including push buttons, may optionally be configured to behave as
            toggle buttons. For example, see the push buttons in the application below. Clicking a
            button causes it to retain a pressed state; clicking it again releases the button:

        <application class="org.apache.pivot.wtk.ScriptApplication" width="240" height="80">
            <libraries>
                <library>core</library>
                <library>wtk</library>

            </startup-properties>
        </application>

        <p>The WTKX source for the example is below:</p>

        <source type="xml" location="org/apache/pivot/tutorials/buttons/toggle_buttons.wtkx">
            <![CDATA[
<Window title="Toggle Buttons" maximized="true"
    xmlns:wtkx="http://pivot.apache.org/wtkx"
    xmlns:content="org.apache.pivot.wtk.content"
    xmlns="org.apache.pivot.wtk">
    <content>
        <BoxPane styles="{padding:4, horizontalAlignment:'center',
            verticalAlignment:'center'}">
            <PushButton toggleButton="true">
                <buttonData>
                    <content:ButtonData text="Anchor" icon="org/apache/pivot/tutorials/anchor.png"/>
                </buttonData>
            </PushButton>
            <PushButton toggleButton="true">
                <buttonData>
                    <content:ButtonData text="Cup" icon="org/apache/pivot/tutorials/cup.png"/>
                </buttonData>
            </PushButton>
            <PushButton toggleButton="true">
                <buttonData>
                    <content:ButtonData text="Star" icon="org/apache/pivot/tutorials/star.png"/>
                </buttonData>
            </PushButton>
        </BoxPane>
    </content>
</Window>
]]>
        </source>

        <p>
            Note that the push buttons in the example display both an icon and a text label. The
            data for each button is specified as an instance of
            <tt>org.apache.pivot.wtk.content.ButtonData</tt>, which defines "icon" and "text"
            properties. In addition to simple string data, the default button data renderer is
            also capable of displaying button data provided in this manner.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note also that the values of the "icon" attributes do not begin with an '@' symbol. In
            WTKX, image URLs are commonly specified with this prefix, to indicate that an image's
            location is relative to the WTKX source file currently being loaded. An image path
            without an '@' prefix, such as those in this example, is generally treated as an
            absolute location relative to the application's classpath.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, note that the buttons' states are all managed independently: clicking one
            button does not affect the selection state of the others. This is because the buttons
            are not part of a group. Had the buttons all been assigned to the same group, only a
            single button would be selected at a time, and clicking one button would automatically
            deselect the previously selected button.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because this application doesn't require any special logic, there is no Java source for
            this example; the example is launched using the
            <tt>org.apache.pivot.wtk.ScriptApplication</tt> class.
