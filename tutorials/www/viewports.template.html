<h1>Viewports</h1>

<p><tt>Viewport</tt> is abstract base class for "viewport" components. Viewports provide a windowed view on a component (called the "view") that is too large to fit within a given area. They are generally scrollable, though their means for scrolling the view may differ. Pivot includes two viewport components: <a href="scroll_panes.html">ScrollPane</a> and <a href="panoramas.html">Panorama</a>. Scroll panes facilitate scrolling by presenting a vertical or horizontal scroll bar that the user can drag to access the obscured parts of the view. Panoramas scroll via four directional scroll arrows shown at the top, left, bottom, or right as needed.</p>
