<p>Provides classes for communicating with HTTP-based web services.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, a web query is simply an <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt" target="_blank">HTTP</a> request. However, the default data format used by a web query is not HTML, but JSON. This allows a caller to effectively invoke database-like operations over the web - the HTTP methods are used in a manner that is very similar to their corresponding SQL equivalents:<p>

<table style="border-collapse:collapse; border:solid 1px #999999">
    <thead>
        <td style="font-weight:bold">HTTP Method</td>
        <td style="font-weight:bold">SQL Query</td>
        <td style="font-weight:bold">Behavior</td>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>POST</tt></td>
        <td><tt>INSERT</tt></td>
        <td>Create</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>GET</tt></td>
        <td><tt>SELECT</tt></td>
        <td>Read</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>PUT</tt></td>
        <td><tt>UPDATE</tt></td>
        <td>Update</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>DELETE</tt></td>
        <td><tt>DELETE</tt></td>
        <td>Delete</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>These operations, sometimes referred to as "CRUD", form the basis of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">Representational State Transfer</a> (REST) model of building web services. Pivot web queries are designed primarily to facilitate interaction with JSON-based REST services. However, they are sufficiently generic to support communication with any type of HTTP-based service, using any data format (for example, XML). This enables web queries to be used in a broad range of server communication scenarios.</p>
