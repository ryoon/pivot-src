Defines skin classes for the "Terra" theme.
</p>
<p>
Terra skins get their colors from the theme's color palette, which contains
24 indexed colors.  Each Terra skin exposes setter methods for each of its
color styles that take an integer value; such methods allow callers to style
the component by referencing the theme's color palette.  The default palette
is shown below:
</p>
<p>
<img src="doc-files/palette.png" border="0"/>
<br/>
<font color="#000000" size="-1" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif">
<i>The default color palette</i>
</font>
</p>

<p>The font and color palette is defined in a JSON file that should contain a
<tt>Map</tt> containing the following properties:</p>

<p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<th nowrap="nowrap">Property:</th>
<th nowrap="nowrap">Type:</th>
<th nowrap="nowrap">Description:</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><tt>font</tt></td>
<td><tt>String</tt></td>
<td>
The default theme font; must be understandable by
<tt>java.awt.Font.decode()</tt>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><tt>colors</tt></td>
<td><tt>List&lt;String&gt;</tt></td>
<td>
This list should contain 8 colors in a form understandable by
<tt>java.awt.Color.decode()</tt>. This list represents the theme's
"base color palette", from which the full color palette is
derived. Each of these 8 colors will be expanded to comprise 3
colors in the final palette: a darker version, the color itself,
and a lighter version. Thus, the final color palette will contain
24 colors. For instance, in the <a href="#palette">default color
palette</a> the "base palette" colors are the colors in the middle
column.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>By default, the theme definition in <tt>TerraTheme_default.json</tt> is used,
but can be overridden via the <tt>org.apache.pivot.wtk.skin.terra.location</tt>
property.</p>
