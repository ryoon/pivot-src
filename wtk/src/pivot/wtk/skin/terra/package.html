      Defines skin classes for the "Terra" theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terra skins get their colors from the theme's color palette, which contains
      24 indexed colors.  Each Terra skin exposes setter methods for each of its
      color styles that take an integer value; such methods allow callers to style
      the component by referencing the theme's color palette.  The default palette
      is shown below:
